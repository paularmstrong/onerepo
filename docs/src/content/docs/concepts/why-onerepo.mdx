**oneRepo** is a suite of tools for managing JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos, with the goal of enabling speed and confidence for all changes.

Other monorepo tooling either does too much or not enough in order to maintain a healthy monorepo for distributed organizations that need conformance, stability, and discoverability.

- **Safe and strict:** Other tools rely on manually configuring globs of files that contribute to Workspace integrity and decision making for whether or not checks and tasks must run. oneRepo, on the other hand _does not_ use a cache and automatically determines which Workspaces, tasks, and checks must run for any given change. We sacrifice a little bit of speed for strict correctness.
- **Source level dependencies:** When working within the monorepo all import/require chains come from the _source_ files; never requires building shared packages to capture changes.

## Tenets

- **Documented:** All commands and options must be documented and respond to `--help` requests.
- **Discoverable:** Code for commands must be easy to find and trace.
- **Clear output:** All log output must be grouped, labelled with purpose, and clearly defined by its state.

## Alternatives & pitfalls

### Script overload

Many tools available for JavaScript repos rely on writing individual commands into each Workspace’s [`package.json` `"scripts"` field](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts). This creates both a brittle setup, copy/paste boilerplate, reduced reusability, and limited documentation & discoverability.

Take for example, the following real world _portion_ of an application. This `package.json` had 43 various scripts _just_ for running `cypress`. None of these were documented and many may be completely or nearly identical.

```json collapse={6-42} title="package.json"
{
	"scripts": {
		"cy:install": "cypress install",
		"cy:cli": "cypress run",
		"cy:ui": "cypress open",
		"cy:local:cli": "cypress run",
		"cy:local:cli:desktop": "cypress run --config viewportWidth=1440,viewportHeight=900",

		"cy:percy:local": "npx percy exec -- cypress open --config baseUrl=http://localhost:3000/",
		"cy:percy:test": "npx percy exec -- cypress open --config baseUrl=https://test.example.com/",
		"cy:percy:record": "npx percy exec -- cypress run --record --spec 'cypress/e2e/**.spec.js'",
		"cy:record:local": "npx cypress run --record --config baseUrl=http://localhost:3000/ --spec 'cypress/e2e/**.spec.js'",
		"cy:run": "npx cypress run --record false --spec 'cypress/e2e/**.spec.js'",
		"cy:run:local": "npx cypress run --config baseUrl=http://localhost:3001/ --record false --spec 'cypress/e2e/**.spec.js'",
		"cy:test:run:desktop": "cypress run --config baseUrl=https://test.example.com,viewportWidth=1440,viewportHeight=900",
		"cy:test:run:tablet": "cypress run --config baseUrl=https://test.example.com,viewportWidth=1024,viewportHeight=768",
		"cy:verify": "npx cypress verify",
		"cy:version": "npx cypress version",
		"cy:register": "npx cypress run --record --key 3a8de5fe-003c-431b-9685-385178dd5069 --group registration --spec cypress/e2e/registration.spec.js",
		"cy:login": "npx cypress run --record --key 3a8de5fe-003c-431b-9685-385178dd5069 --group submit-app --spec cypress/e2e/login.spec.js",
		"cy:workflow": "npx cypress run --record --key 3a8de5fe-003c-431b-9685-385178dd5069"
	}
}
```

This behavior we refer to as _script overload_.

Furthermore, it is difficult to remember how to run scripts in individual Workspaces due to lack of documentation on `package.json` scripts – and other tooling does not provide a way to enforce standards or help developers find what they’re looking for – relying instead on manual documentation, or worse, memory.

Other pitfalls with npm scripts and similar DSL-like implementations like [Nx task pipelines](https://nx.dev/recipes/running-tasks/defining-task-pipeline) and [moonrepo tasks](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/create-task) require developers to succumb to _script overload_ through task chaining.

Because you need to define multiple steps separately that need to be run in order to build a module that includes ESM, CJS, and TS definitions, you might end up with this (naïve and shortened version) of a configuration.

```yaml title="moon.yml"  collapse={4-9,13-18,22-27}
tasks:
  build-esm:
    command: esbuild --format=esm
    inputs:
      - ./src/**/*
    outputs:
      - ./dist/esm
    options:
      runInCI: false

  build-cjs:
    command: esbuild --format=cjs
    inputs:
      - ./src/**/*
    outputs:
      - ./dist/cjs
    options:
      runInCI: false

  build-tsdefs:
    command: tsc -b tsconfig.json --emitDeclarationOnly
    inputs:
      - ./src/**/*
    outputs:
      - ./dist/src
    options:
      runInCI: false

  build:
    deps:
      - build-esm
      - build-cjs
      - build-tsdefs
```

While this may seem okay to start, as repos grow and become complex, Workspaces may have unique needs and need conditional checks for whether they should run certain portions of tasks or not. Using a DSL requires developers to learn _yet another thing_ or rely on dedicated teams to build infrastructure for them.

### Cache inconsistency

Avoiding extra work by utilizing cached responses based on a set of input files is a great time saver in theory. The problem is that the responsibility of knowing exactly what files and Workspaces affect the cache for each individual task lies on you and your team.

```json title="modules/my-project/nx.json" collapse={2-11}
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
	"tasksRunnerOptions": {
		"default": {
			"runner": "nx/tasks-runners/default",
			"options": {
				"cacheableOperations": ["build"]
			}
		}
	},
	"targetDefaults": {
		"build": {
			"inputs": ["default", "^production"]
		}
	},
	"namedInputs": {
		"default": ["{projectRoot}/**/*", "sharedGlobals"],
		"sharedGlobals": ["{workspaceRoot}/prisma/**", "{workspaceRoot}/babel.config.json"],
		"production": ["default", "{projectRoot}/tsconfig.json"]
	}
}
```

The main problem with cache-based solutions is that you and your team need to keep knowledge of the inputs & outputs to each task or target when making major changes to ensure that you haven't added or modified to the determinism without also updating the configuration. It is impossible to expect everyone to know everything all the time and changes will inevitably slip through the cracks, leaving your team confused as to why.

Can you spot where the problem with the previous build task may have issues with cache consistency? It's okay if you aren't sure, because there isn't enough information to provided (issue #1!).

What if we also provide the `./tsconfig.json`?

```json title="modules/my-project/tsconfig.json"
{
	"extends": "@internal/tsconfig/base.json",
	"compilerOptions": {
		"outDir": "./dist"
	},
	"include": ["./src/**/*"],
	"exclude": ["./dist"]
}
```

Hint: let's highlight the important part at line 2 from the `tsconfig.json` and compare to the `namedInputs` in the `nx.json`:

```json title="modules/my-project/tsconfig.json" ins="../../shared/tsconfig/base.json"
{
	"extends": "../../shared/tsconfig/base.json",
	"compilerOptions": {
		"outDir": "./dist"
	},
	"include": ["./src/**/*"],
	"exclude": ["./dist"]
}
```

Because it's expected that this may not be abundantly clear: `../../shared/tsconfig/base.json` is outside of the local Workspace and _not_ declared as an input to consider for cache consistency.

If we were to make any modifications to the `compilerOptions` within the `../../shared/tsconfig/base.json` file, we would expect to need to run a full build of `my-project` _without_ any cache. However, because of the way the cache configuration is done in Nx (and other monorepo tools), it's easily missed or mis-configured.

## Human-readable output

One big frustration with other tooling is that the log output is difficult for humans to read – particularly when running tasks in parallel. Most monorepo tooling will buffer everything immediately to the output, interleaving parallel task output together, making it difficult to follow what is happening and where there may be issues or all is fine.

```

oneRepo solves for this by waiting grouping output by individual task. While running, by default, only the most recent or most important information will be shown. Output will _never_ be interwoven between individual tasks. And without manually requesting more verbose output, superfluous information will be hidden:

```ansi title="Log types within a step"

## History

oneRepo is inspired by closed source implementations at major companies like Twitter, Zillow Rentals, and Microsoft for Startups.
