In a typical monorepo, we want to build up changes for publishable workspaces over time while we work on features and major changes. Because we are using a monorepo with _source dependencies_, we should not need to publish often, because our local Workspace's are benefitting from code changes immediately.

We still may have certain modules that we publish to a public or private registry. Developer workflows will have a few additional steps.

One of the few opinionated pieces of oneRepo is in how publishable modules log & track changes, update versions, and publish to their registry. All of this is handled by the `change` command set.

## Getting started

Unlike other change entry systems, oneRepo compiles change entry files into a `.changes` folder within each workspace. These files use incremental IDs to help developers review potential order of changes as well as a unique string to prevent collisions across branches. By default, the change entries will be named with a hash of their contents:

<FileTree>

- modules
  - burritos
    - .changes
      - 1-978af1g.md
      - 2-3ah36g1.md
    - package.json
  - tacos
    - .changes
      - 1-978af1g.md
    - package.json

</FileTree>

### Funny filenames

If you prefer something a little more fun, add the [human-id](https://www.npmjs.com/package/human-id) package to your Root Workspace and set `changes.filenames` to `'human'` in your Root configuration file.

## Workflow

### Code changes

<Instructions>
<InstructionStep title="Modify code and add change files">
  <span slot="content">
  For each Workspaces that publishes a module, whenever we commit notable changes that should appear in a changelog, we add change entry files using `one change add` command. This command will help us create individual changelog entries in the form of Markdown formatted files with YAML frontmatter. The files are stored away in each related Workspace until needed later.
  </span>
  <span slot="terminal">

<InstructionStep title="Commit files">

Add change entries will create Markdown files with the change entry content in each appropriate workspace. You will see these files in `<workspace>/.changes/*.md`.

</InstructionStep>
</Instructions>

### Version & publish

Eventually, we will need to publish one or more Workspaces to our registry for use in another repository. To do this, we follow another short workflow:

<Instructions>
<InstructionStep title="Update versions">
  <span slot="content">
  First, we _increment the version_ automatically using the command `one change version`. This command will prompt for the Workspace or Workspaces that we would like to publish and automatically ensure that any dependencies with changes are also incremented appropriately.

This extra increment is necessary to ensure that each Workspace is published with the latest changes. Without this step, it would be possible that critical features would end up missing and causing errors in your published modules.

<InstructionStep title="Verify new versions">
  <span slot="content">

Next, you will be asked to verify new versions. This step will list new versions for dependencies of the Workspace(s) that you requested to version that also have changes in them.

You _cannot_ version and publish the requested Workspaces without including these Workspaces as well.

{/* @generated SignedSource<<aaf3ba825667d217308ab86cd6049c96>> */}

### `one change`

Aliases: `one changes`, `one changesets`

Manage changes and changesets for publishable workspaces.

```sh
one change <command>
```

---

#### `one change add`

Aliases: `one change`

Add changesets for modified Workspaces.

```sh
one change add [options...]
```

This command will prompt for appropriate Workspace(s), prompt for the release type, and request a descriptive change entry. Once all information has been entered, a change entry file will be created in the appropriate Workspace(s). Be sure to commit these files – they will be used later when you are ready to version and publish Workspaces to the registry for use outside of the Monorepo.

#### `one change publish`

Aliases: `one change release`

Publish all Workspaces with versions not available in the registry.

```sh
one change publish [options]
```

This command is safe to run any time. By default, only Workspaces that have previously gone through the `one change version` process will end up being published. Use `--all` for all Workspaces or `--workspaces <workspace-name>` to specify individual Workspaces to try publishing.

For each Workspace, the registry will be queried first to ensure the current version in the Workspace does not yet exist in the registry. If a version _does_ exist, the Workspace will be skipped.

Publish the `api` Workspace and its dependencies, if necessary.

```sh
one change publish -w api
```

Attempt to publish _all_ non-private Workspaces.

```sh
one change publish --all
```

---

#### `one change snapshot`

Aliases: `one change snap`

Publish a snapshot pre-release.

```sh
one change snapshot
```

Periodically you may want to publish a _snapshot_ release – something that needs testing from the registry, but should not update the current version nor be made widely available. For these cases, use `--snapshot` and versions will be published in the format `0.0.0-{tag}-{hash}`, where `{hash}` is a short version of the current git sha. By appending a prerelease to version `0.0.0`, discoverability is greatly reduced.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>**Can I edit change files?**</summary>
Yes. This is one of the main benefits of the approach we use. All change files are tracked in your git repository until they're ready to be consumed by a the [`change version`](#one-change-version) command. Until then, it's safe to add, edit, or delete change files as needed.

Got a typo? Want to add more context? No problem! Just modify the appropriate change files, commit them, and move on.

</details>
<details>
<summary>**Versioning deleted my change files. Is that okay?**</summary>
This is expected! Change files are temporary placeholders that inform the [`change version`](#one-change-version) command how to pick the appropriate next version. Once they are consumed, they get compiled back to each Workspace's `CHANGELOG.md` file.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Can I edit my changelog after it's written?**</summary>
Because change entries are written in isolation, it can be really helpful to edit your `CHANGELOG.md` file after versioning and before publishing to add context and make instructions flow better. You can safely modify your `CHANGELOG.md` files any time.
</details>
<details>
<summary>**Why is the `human-id` package not used by default?**</summary>
oneRepo does its best to limit the number of dependencies it requires, especially those of significant weight. We really like [human-id](https://www.npmjs.com/package/human-id), but it is a large dataset and English-only, so it has been made optional.
</details>

## Alternatives

### Changesets

oneRepo changes are inspired by [🦋 Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). While they provide a lot of the same functionality, there are various issues conflicting with oneRepo:

- Changelogs are written to private packages (Issue [#313](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/issues/313))
- Building and applying release plans is cumbersome with changesets when not using the `@changesets/cli` package directly. The oneRepo [Graph](/api/#graph-1) does a fantastic job of handling Workspace linking and versioning.
- Source Dependencies are one of the main reasons oneRepo was created, as other monorepo tooling doesn't enforce or help with setting up and managing correct linking. Keeping changesets as a plugin makes this too optional and confusing to explain and implement.
- It's easy to forget to write changesets, which can prevent versioning & publishing. Changesets do not also take into account git changes in Workspaces and dependent Workspaces.
- Changesets is haphazardly documented and difficult to onboard large teams. Many potentially helpful docs were stubbed in and forgotten for many years (example: [Problems publishing in monorepos](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/93ee679537fb43111c29359fe6c82164b359e4d1/docs/problems-publishing-in-monorepos.md))

### Conventional commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a standard specification for writing effective change entries via git commit messages. The commits are then parsed in order to determine version release type, breaking changes, and compiling changelogs.

While Conventional Commits is a wonderfully sound approach for single module repositories, it quickly degrades in Monorepos when developers work across a number of Workspaces or have changes that are less deserving of mention in changelogs.

There is also little room for error with Conventional Commits, because changelog entries are set in stone once commits are written – unless you allow _rewriting history_, which you likely do not.
