## Installation

This is a core plugin that does not need to be installed manually.

## Uninstall

Warning: disabling the graph will disable both the `graph`-specifc commands as well as all workspace-specific commands.

```js
(async () => {
	const { run } = await setup({
		core: {
			// Disable the graph entirely from your CLI
			graph: false,
		},
	});

	await run();
})();
```
