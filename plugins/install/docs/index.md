## Installation

		core: {
			// Disable the install plugin
			install: false,
		},
	});

	await run();
})();
```

## `one install`

Install the oneRepo CLI into your environment.

`npx something-something`? `npm run what`? `yarn that-thing`? `../../../bin/one`? Forget all of that; no more will you need to figure out how to run your CLI. Just install it directly into your user bin PATH with this command.

As an added bonus, tab-completions will be added to your .zshrc or .bash_profile (depending on your current shell).

The `install` command does not accept any positional arguments.
