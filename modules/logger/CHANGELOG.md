## 1.0.1

### Patch changes

- Prevents an EventEmitter memory leak stemming from the logger's internal `LogBuffer` by piping streams instead of adding and removing listeners. ([f22e04d](https://github.com/paularmstrong/onerepo/commit/f22e04d4e589f4efe660fd8cf940ebf026b39542))
  Previously, you may experience the following error when receiving a lot of output from subprocesses (particularly eslint):
  ```
  (node:30394) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 data listeners added to [LogBuffer]. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit
  (Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
  ```
